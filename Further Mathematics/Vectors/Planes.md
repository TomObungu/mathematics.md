A plane a two dimensional flat surface that extends infinitley. A plane looks like this on the 3D vector plane. ![[Pasted image 20250912205932.png]]
- A plane is denoted $\Pi$. 
- A plane can be defined by a known point $r_{0}$ and any two non-parallel vectors that are in the plane.
- Any point $r$ in the plane cab represented by adding a combination of the two vectors to the known point $r_{0}$

$$
\Pi:r=r_{0}+\lambda b+\mu c
$$
Where $b$ and $c$ are any two non-parallel vectors that lie on the same plane.

Note that if two lines intersect, then they lie on the same plane:
