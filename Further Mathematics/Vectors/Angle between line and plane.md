To find the angle between an a plane, it possible to calculate the normal $\vec{n}$ of the plane first, if given it in non-scalar product form. However if you are given a plane in scalar product form, you use the normal vector from the formula first.

The geometric interpretation of the angle is the angle between the direction vector $\vec{d}$ and the normal $\vec{n}$. Hower since $\vec{n}$ is perpendicular to $\vec{d}$ the angle
