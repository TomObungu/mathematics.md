To find the angle between an a plane, it possible to calculate the normal $\vec{n}$ of the plane first, if given it in non-scalar product form. However if you are given a plane in scalar product form, you use the normal vector from the formula first. 

## Why
The geometric interpretation of the angle is the angle between the direction vector $\vec{d}$ and the normal $\vec{n}$.  The angle can be calculated using the dot product:

$$
\cos\theta = \frac{\vec{d} \cdot  \vec{n}}{|\vec{d}||\vec{n}|}
$$



This is because the intersections between the normal, line and plane all form a right angle triangle.

The angle $<FED$ will be cos$\theta$.

The angle between the line and the plane will be T angle $<EDF$. This angle $@\phi$ is the line makes with the plane will be $\phi = 90 - \theta$ to . 

However recall that:
$$
\sin@= \sin@
$$
