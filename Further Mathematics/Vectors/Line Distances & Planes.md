The shortest test distance is the perpendicular distance to the line.  Therefore you must work $\vec{AB}$ then where $A$ is the point and $B$ is the general point on the line. 

Then you must dot product $\vec{AB}$ with the direction vector of the line and demand it is equal to 0. This is because if you recall from[[Dot Product (Scalar Product)]]. The dot product of
