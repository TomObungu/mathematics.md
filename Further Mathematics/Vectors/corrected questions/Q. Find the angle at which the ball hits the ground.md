### b) Direction of motion as it hits the ground.

Substitute λ=1.4λ=1.4 into the velocity vector:

v=(9−4.6×1.4)i+15j+(0.8−2×1.4)kv=(9−4.6×1.4)i+15j+(0.8−2×1.4)k

Calculate:

- i: 9−6.44=2.569−6.44=2.56
    
- j: 1515
    
- k: 0.8−2.8=−2.00.8−2.8=−2.0  
    So,
    

v=2.56i+15j−2.0kv=2.56i+15j−2.0k

**Answer (b):** 2.56i+15j−2.0k2.56i+15j−2.0k

c) For part recall that the direction of motion is always tangential to the displacement. This means the angle of impact depends on the direction of motion (velocity) at the point of impact, not the position. The position only tells you where it is, but not which way it is moving.

The velocity vector $\mathbf{v}$ is the derivative of $\mathbf{r}$ with respect to $\mathbf{\lambda}$(which is proportional to time). So it gives the instantaneous direction of motion.

This is because velocity is always tangential to motion and will always give the angle of the direction of motion.

The position vector will only give the coordinates of the the ball. However the velocity will give you the direction of travel

Think of it as the equation of a line: the position (s) is the starting position and velocity v is the direction vector paired with $\lambda$

However recall to find the angle between a line a plane you must use $\sin\theta$ = the dot product of the direction vector and the normal. 

In this case the velocity is the direction vector.
