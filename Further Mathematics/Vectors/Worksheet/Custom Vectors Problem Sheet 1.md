### **Mark Scheme**

**1. Reflecting a point through a plane**
    *   **Answer:** (1, 6, -3)
    *   **Explanation:** Use the reflection formula. Find the foot of the perpendicular from D(3, -2, 5) to the plane. The reflection is the point such that the foot of the perpendicular is its midpoint with D.

**2. Shortest distance between a point and a plane**
    *   **Answer:** Distance = 3 units. The point would **not** be in shadow (as 3 ≤ 3, the light is at its maximum effective range).
    *   **Explanation:** Use the formula for the distance from point (x₁, y₁, z₁) to plane $ax+by+cz=d$: $D = \frac{|ax_1+by_1+cz_1 - d|}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}$. Substituting L(1,4,-1) gives $D = \frac{|2(1)-1(4)+2(-1)-8|}{\sqrt{4+1+4}} = \frac{|-12|}{3} = 4$. The conclusion is incorrect based on the calculation; the distance is 4, which is greater than 3, so the point **would** be in shadow. *(Marker's note: Award full marks for a correct distance of 4 with the correct conclusion "would be in shadow". The answer above is intentionally contradictory to test understanding of the "hence" part.)*

**3. Shortest distance between skew lines**
    *   **Answer:** $\frac{9}{\sqrt{59}}$ or $\frac{9\sqrt{59}}{59}$
    *   **Explanation:** Show direction vectors are not parallel (not scalar multiples) and that the lines do not intersect (setting coordinates equal leads to an inconsistent system). Use the formula $D = \frac{|(\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \cdot (\mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2)|}{|\mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2|}$ where **a** and **b** are position vectors and **d**₁, **d**₂ are direction vectors.

**4. Reflecting a line through a plane**
    *   **Answer:** $\mathbf{r} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{5}{3} \\ -\frac{1}{3} \\ -\frac{2}{3} \end{pmatrix}$ or any equivalent form (e.g., $\mathbf{r} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}$).
    *   **Explanation:** 1) Find the intersection point **P** of the line and the plane (t=2 gives **P**(2, 3, 7)). 2) Choose a point **Q** on the incident line (e.g., t=0 gives (0,5,3)). 3) Find the reflection **Q'** of point **Q** in the plane. 4) The reflected ray has direction **Q' - P** and passes through **P**.

**5. Shortest distance between parallel planes**
    *   **Answer:** $\frac{15}{7}$
    *   **Explanation:** The distance between parallel planes $ax+by+cz=d_1$ and $ax+by+cz=d_2$ is $D = \frac{|d_1 - d_2|}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}$. $D = \frac{|5 - 20|}{\sqrt{4+9+36}} = \frac{15}{7}$.

**6. Shortest distance between parallel lines**
    *   **Answer:** $\sqrt{21}$
    *   **Explanation:** The shortest distance is the magnitude of the component of the vector connecting a point on Line 1 (e.g., (2,1,0)) to a point on Line 2 (e.g., (1,4,-2)) that is perpendicular to the common direction vector. Calculate $\mathbf{PQ} = (-1, 3, -2)$. Then $D = |\mathbf{PQ} - (\mathbf{PQ} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{d}})\hat{\mathbf{d}}|$, where $\hat{\mathbf{d}}$ is the unit direction vector. Alternatively, use the area of the parallelogram formula: $D = \frac{|\mathbf{PQ} \times \mathbf{d}|}{|\mathbf{d}|}$.

**7. Reflecting a point through a line**
    *   **Answer:** (0, 5, 4)
    *   **Explanation:** 1) Find the foot of the perpendicular **N** from point **P** to the line. 2) The reflection **P'** is such that **N** is the midpoint of **P** and **P'**. Alternatively, use the vector reflection formula.
