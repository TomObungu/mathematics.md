Prompt:
Generate non multiple choice questions, i.e questions that do not show the options of the answers on the questions but have the answers stored separate after the last questions in a mark scheme with very brief explanations of the answers. Ensure the questions are doable but have a degree of difficulty and problem solving with context. The questions will be for the A Level Further Mathematics Core Pure 1 Syllabus for the vectors topic. Within the vectors topic the specific sub-topics of vectors will be: Reflecting a line through a plane Reflecting a point through a plane Shortest distance between parallel planes Shortest distance between skew lines Shortest distance between a point and a plane Shortest distance between parallel lines Reflecting a point through a line
