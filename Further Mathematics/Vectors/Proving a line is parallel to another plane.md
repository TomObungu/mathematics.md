If a line and plane are parallel, this means the dot product between the direction vector and normal of the other plane will be 0.


- Plane: $( \pi: 2x - 3y + z = 6 ).$ Its normal vector is $( \vec{n} = (2, -3, 1) )$.
- Line: $( L: \vec{r} = (1, 0, 2) + t(3, 2, 0) )$. Its direction vector is $( \vec{d} = (3, 2, 0) ).$

$$
\begin{gather*}
\text{Check if } \vec{d} \cdot \vec{n} = 0: \\ \\
\vec{d} \cdot \vec{n} = (3)(2) + (2)(-3) + (0)(1) = 6 - 6 + 0 = 0.
\end{gather*}
$$

So, the line is parallel to the plane.
