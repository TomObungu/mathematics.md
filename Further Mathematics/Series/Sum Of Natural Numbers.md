## Sum of a constant $k$
To find the sum of a series of a constant number $k$ you can use the formula:
$$
\sum_{r=1}^n k = nk
$$
## Sum of all n up to n
To find the sum of a the natural numbers from $1$ to $r$ you can use the formula:
$$
\sum_{r=1}^nr=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$
This evaluated equation is also the formula for the $nth$ triangular number

# Summation Of a series that does not start with $r=1$

It is possible to split the summation into two separate parts by evaluation:
$$
\sum_{r=k}^n=\sum_{r=1}
$$
